## Knowledge graph
_Entities_: shelters, other housing providers; food pantries; clinics; social service providers; data sources;  

_Properties_: supply + demand volume, geographic scope (for services); schema / properties (for data sources);  

_Sample questions to answer_: 
* On a map: 'where can I stay tonight?' 'where can I go for <service X>'  'what property is available for new housing development/conversion?' 'what properties are vacant?'
* * Examples: [Shelter.app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.strappd)
* Generally: 'how do I match someone with housing? (e.g. via Common Entry)' 'How can I match someone w/ a voucher with a unit?' 'what services am I eligible for and how do I sign up?'
* Per city: 'How many housing vouchers were distributed this year? What % haven't been used? How long is the waiting list?'  'What funded programs are available, how under/oversubscribed are they?'
